### Available Apps

#### Lucky Miner

**Version:** 1.0.1

Lucky Miner is a lightweight CPU mining app for Umbrel that lets you solo mine Bitcoin just for the thrill of it. Think of it as a fun, lotto-style mining experiment — no fancy rigs or profits expected, just your CPU giving it a shot. You can watch real hashes roll by, track your stats, and feel like part of the mining adventure without the noise or heat of a real farm.

Because hey, if there's a hash, there's a chance.

**Features:**
- Web interface for CPU mining configuration
- Real-time hash rate monitoring
- Mining statistics tracking
- Solo mining support
